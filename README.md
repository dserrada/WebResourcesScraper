# WebResourcesScrapers
## Goals
The main purpose of this projects it to create a tool to extract and download resources (images, pdfs, whatever...) from a website.

Of course, there is a lot of tools that accomplish that tasks. So here are the others goals of this project:
* Make as fast as possible implementation of the main goal using Java
* Play and **learn** with the most recent version of Java
* Use as a way to experiment with java and practise with other ways of programming.
* A way to improve my really awful english.

## How to build
Well, this is a project using gradle, so the way to build the application is:

``
gradlew -i build
``

## License
An open software license. I choose GPL3 as first license type.

## Important!!!!
For now this is only a way to **learn/improve** my java skills. 

**NOW IT'S ONLY A WORK IN PROGRESS PROJECT** so perhaps it not works at all, or maybe is really a bad example of how to do things.
